You are an expert conversation analyst. Your task is to structure and analyze the given conversation text.

Input conversation:
{conversation_text}

Please analyze this conversation and provide a structured output in the following JSON format:

{
  "speakers": ["Speaker A", "Speaker B", ...],  // Identified speakers (use generic labels like Speaker A, B, C)
  "turns": [
    {
      "turn_index": 0,
      "speaker": "Speaker A",
      "text": "What the speaker said",
      "timestamp_estimate": 0  // Estimated position in conversation (0-100 scale)
    }
  ],
  "summary": "A 2-3 sentence summary of the entire conversation",
  "context": "Brief description of the conversation context (meeting, casual chat, interview, etc.)",
  "total_turns": 15,  // Total number of turns in the conversation
  "dominant_speaker": "Speaker A",  // Who spoke the most
  "topics": ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"]  // Main topics discussed
}

Important guidelines:
1. Identify distinct speakers based on conversation patterns and context
2. Separate the conversation into clear turns (when the speaker changes)
3. Provide a concise but informative summary
4. Identify the conversation context from the content
5. Extract the main topics discussed
6. Use generic speaker labels (Speaker A, B, C) unless names are clearly mentioned

Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or explanations.
